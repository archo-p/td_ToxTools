# td_ToxTools
 A flexible system for externalizing and saving toxes in TouchDesigner

Many thanks to Matthew Ragan's work.  This system uses some of his initial concepts as well as the handy "flash" technique for feedback.

As well to Matthew Gonzalez for doing much of the work!

See documentation in Packages/Resources for more details on use.

Actual useable tox is Packages/ToxTools.  Development and testing occurs in the toe.
