9-15-2020 v0.2.4

- fixed things up so that already externalized comps save to whatever they are set to or expressed to without resetting external tox value and also preserving expressed external tox parameters
- updated function flow to always route through managers, so that bulk save confroms to all parameters of manager
- possibly still some edge cases to drudge up


8-4-2020 v0.2.2

- Fixed so that Save Backups off actually works and will no longer make the Backup folder or save timestamped tox copy if the toffgle is off
- Dirty Tox dialog will close apon pressing save selected, it will re-check for dity and reopen if there are still dirty comps, figured this was a good way to make sure you know there are still dirty toxes
- hard set an attribute in tox tools related to there only being a single manager in this current version so that there is no searching for correct manager, will make thigns faster.  In later version will add a check for whether there are other managers, but for now we are only using the one embedded in the tool.

Fixes and refinements for Intent Dev usage.  
- Moving away from the notion of multiple managers, though still technically possible.
- Main internal devToxManager is made to be soley used
- Config file setup, saving and loading is completely internal
- fixed unsaved list dialog so that all dirty toxes show selected on display
- added Save Root Only toggle to manager, meaning only that comp will save with the save shortcut
- added checks when in this Save Root Only mode to warn user if they've saved from within another external COMP and provide options
