7-24-2020 v0.2.1

Fixes and refinements for Intent Dev usage.  
- Moving away from the notion of multiple managers, though still technically possible.
- Main internal devToxManager is made to be soley used
- Config file setup, saving and loading is completely internal
- fixed unsaved list dialog so that all dirty toxes show selected on display
- added Save Root Only toggle to manager, meaning only that comp will save with the save shortcut
- added checks when in this Save Root Only mode to warn user if they've saved from within another external COMP and provide options
