ToxTools documentation 
last update July 24 2020 :: Peter Sistrom :: 0.2.1

This component is meant to provide wide flexibility in developing in an external tox workflow.

To use place the ToxTools.tox found in Packages/ToxTools into the root of your project.  Open the Tox Manager Pars, set your root, go into your root and start saving comps with ctrl+alt+s!

By default a number of keyboard shortcuts are active, all of which can be adjusted and turned off.

A built in configuration setup is provided to allow customization of usage but keeping the ToxTools component external if desired.

The parameters on ToxTools itself are mainly for configuring the shortcuts and saving/loading your config file.

To access usage customization the easiest way is to use the default shortcut ctrl+alt+t, or you can hit the "Tox Manager Pars" pulse on the Shortcuts page of ToxTools.  This gives you access to the parameters of /ToxTools/devToxManager.

The manager is seperated from the package because the notion of multiple managers is possible though not currently the intended use.

For an in depth description of the various parameters on the devToxManager refer to its help text by pressing the Help pulse on the manager pars.

At a high level ToxTools can allow for the following workflows:

- specifiying a root to "manage" so that paths not within scope cannot be saved easily.
- auto creating folders based on the network paths of components that get saved and a specified root folder
- configuring whether to leave backups in the toe, as well as copying and timestamp previously saved toxes in order to prevent work loss.
- check for external parents in the case of newly saved children and warn or provide quick save options
- check for all unsaved comps within the specified root via defauly ctrl+alt+u shortcut or when saving the toe or using special quit shortcut ctrl+alt+q
- hand select from said list to specify what to save in bulk
- set manager to save only one comp, the specified root, with warnings and options if an existing external within is attempted saving.
- optionally add a Tox Version par to saved components that increments before saving.

Recently untested features include the ability to externalize whole swaths of a hierarchy via defined tags.
This is what is refered to on the NetworkDump page of the devToxManager, but has not been revisted in a little while and is likely buggy.
